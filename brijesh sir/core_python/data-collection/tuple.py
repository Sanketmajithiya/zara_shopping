Tuple : ordered, immutable, indexing, slicing, duplicate values are allowed 
In Python, a tuple is an immutable collection of elements. Immutable means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed or modified. Tuples are ordered, meaning the elements have a specific order, and they can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, or even other tuples.

Tuples are defined using parentheses () and comma , to separate the elements. For example:

tuple_name = tuple()
tuple_name = ()
comma_tuple = 1,
