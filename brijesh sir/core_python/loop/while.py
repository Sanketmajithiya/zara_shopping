"""
In Python, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. The general syntax of a while loop in Python is as follows:

while condition:
    # code of block

# while True:
#     print("brijesh gondaliya")


# while True:
#     age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
#     if age>=18:
#         weight = int(input("Enter your weight: "))
#         if weight >= 50:
#             print("You can donate")
#         else:
#             print("You can not donate")
#     else:
#         print("You can not donate")


# table = int(input("Enter a table number: "))
# start = 1
# end = 10

# while(start<=end):
#     print(f"{table} * {start} = {table * start}")
#     start += 1
