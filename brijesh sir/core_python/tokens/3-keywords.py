"""
In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, functions, classes, etc.) in your code. These keywords are part of the language's syntax and are used to define the structure and logic of a program. They serve specific purposes and cannot be redefined or assigned new meanings.

False               class               from                or

False: Boolean value representing false.
None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
True: Boolean value representing true.
and: Logical operator for boolean AND.
as: Used in context managers or for creating alias names.
assert: Used for debugging, raises an error if a condition is not true.
async: Declares an asynchronous function or context manager.
await: Used to pause execution in an asynchronous function until the awaited coroutine is complete.
break: Terminates the nearest enclosing loop.
class: Defines a class.
continue: Skips the rest of the loop's code and continues with the next iteration.
def: Defines a function.
del: Deletes a variable or an item in a collection.
elif: Stands for "else if" and is used in conditional statements.
else: Specifies the code to be executed if a condition is false.
except: Catches and handles exceptions.
False: Boolean value representing false.
finally: Specifies a block of code to be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.
for: Initiates a for loop.
from: Used for importing specific attributes or functions from a module.
global: Declares a variable as global, allowing it to be modified outside of its current scope.
if: Conditional statement for executing code based on a given condition.
import: Imports a module or specific attributes from a module.
in: Checks if a value exists in a sequence.
is: Tests object identity.
lambda: Creates an anonymous function (a lambda function).
nonlocal: Declares a variable as nonlocal, allowing it to be modified in an enclosing (but non-global) scope.
not: Logical operator for boolean NOT.
or: Logical operator for boolean OR.
pass: Placeholder for an empty code block.
raise: Raises an exception.
return: Exits a function and optionally returns a value.
try: Defines a block of code to be tested for errors.
while: Initiates a while loop.
with: Simplifies resource management using a context manager.
yield: Pauses a generator function, returning a value to the caller.
