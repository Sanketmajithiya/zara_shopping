"""
In Python, you can use nested if statements or a combination of if, elif, and else statements to create more intricate decision-making structures.

Nested if statements:
Nested if statements are when you have one if statement inside another. Each if statement is checked sequentially, and the inner if statement is only executed if the condition of the outer if statement is true.
