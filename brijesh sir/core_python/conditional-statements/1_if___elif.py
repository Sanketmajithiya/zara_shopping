"""
In Python, the if-else statement is used when you want to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false. The basic syntax is as follows:

if condition:
    # code to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # code to be executed if the condition is false

"""

num1 = 2
num2 = 5
flag = 0

if (num1 <= num2) and flag:
    print("Given condition is True")
else:
    print("Given condition is False")
