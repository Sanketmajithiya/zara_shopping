# razor pay steps
This is the main step of the process. First, we need to understand how payment works in Razorpay.

Create a Razor Order from our Django Server.

Pass Order Id and Other Options to the Frontend.

The user clicks the payment button and pays with one of the payment methods.

Razorpay handles Payment Success and Failure.

On Failure, Razorpay facilitates retry of the payments.

On Success, Razorpay makes a post request to a callback URL on our server.

Verify the payment signature, to confirm that payment is authentic and isnâ€™t tampered with.

Once verified, capture the payment and render the success page.
